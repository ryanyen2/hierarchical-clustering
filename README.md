1. Construct random forest models using different numbers of component trees based on 
a specific training set/test set partition, and analyze the resulting change in 
classification performance.  (25%) 

 

2. For the random forest model corresponding to the best classification performance, 
select different component decision trees in the model, and compare the classification 
performances of these trees with that of the original random forest model. (25%) 

3. For a random forest classifier (or one of its component trees), the relative importance 
of the attributes can be measured through the feature_importances_ field of the 
classifier. For selected component trees in (b), compare their associated lists of 
relative attribute importance values.  (25%)

4. Construct a na√Øve Bayes classifier model based on our data set, and compare the 
classification performance with that of the random forest model.  (25%)
